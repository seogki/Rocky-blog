This article shows to install @next/bundle-analyzer and give idea about how to optimize your bundle size

Bundle size of your webpage is very important, lower to bundle size of your website, faster the rendering page it will be

## Introduction

I was able to reduce my bundle size by using **@next/bundle-anaylzer**, so let's start install

```bash showLineNumbers
npm install @next/bundle-anaylzer
yarn add @next/bundle-anaylzer
pnpm install @next/bundle-anaylzer
```

And from next.config.js add these lines

```js:next.config.js {6-10} showLineNumbers
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  ...
};

const withBundleAnalyzer = require("@next/bundle-analyzer")({
  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === "true"
});

module.exports = withBundleAnalyzer(nextConfig);
```

Since we only need when we want to check our bundle size, **enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === "true"** is recommended


## Check bundle size

After installation, you can find out your bundle size of server side and client side seperately by **ANALYZE=true npm run build**

```bash showLineNumbers
ANALYZE=true npm run build
```

When i saw my bundle size of server, i was able to find my react-icons have multiple **index.esm.js** in 191.js file, which give 2.15 MB even though gzipped

**react-icons** is simple library that help you to import different icons from different libaries

I import few icons that i wanted to use, 
but some how tree shaking seems not working as i expect, 
so i decided find other ways to import my react-icons and i found there is another react-icons library that tree shake works


## Convert react-icons to @react-icons/all-files

First you need to remove react-icons and install @react-icons/all-files

```bash showLineNumbers
npm install @react-icons/all-files
yarn add @react-icons/all-files
pnpm install @react-icons/all-files
```

> Since @react-icons/all-files does not exist some icons that used in default react-icons, so you need to find alternative

```js showLineNumbers
// for examples react-icons import was import { MdMenu } from "react-icons/md";
import {icon-name} from "@react-icons/all-files/[libraries-syntax]/[icon-name]"

// new version
import { MdMenu } from "@react-icons/all-files/md/MdMenu";
```

After changing all icons by **@react-icons/all-files** build again to check your bundle size


## Reduced bundle size

My original bundle size was 2.15 MB but now it reduced by 502.57 KB
