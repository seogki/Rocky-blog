This article describes how to improve nextjs 13 initial performance by using generateStaticParams function

## What is generateStaticParams

GenerateStaticParams function used in combination with [dynamic route segments](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes)
to [statically generate](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default) routes at build time instead of on-demand at request time

Usually handle if you have dynamic routes to produce. In Nextjs 13 **getStaticPaths** is replaced by **generateStaticParams** More Information is provided [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) 

### How the function work

- For Development **generateStaticParams** called when you enter route
- For Production **generateStaticParams** called during *next build*

You may not want to build from server whenever route change because your page does not change at all.
This is depend on your website, because sometimes building *SSG* file can help you increase performance, 
still *CSR* can be better if your file is large.


### Nextjs team recommend

> Static rendering is useful when a route has data that is not personalized to the user and can be known at build time, such as a static blog post or a product page.

## How to implement

From layout or page all you have to do is add **generateStaticParams** function, for example

```tsx:page.tsx showLineNumbers
type Props = {
    params?: {
        slug: string;
        category:string;
    },
}

/** dynamic page will be generate during build on production */
export default async function generateStaticParams() {
    const posts = await fetch("https://...").then((res) => res.json()) // from api
    // const posts = await getAllPosts() //from local

    return posts.map((post) => ({
        slug: post.slug,
        category: post.category
    }))
}

export default function Page({params}:Props) {
    ...
    return <PostItemContainer params={params}/>
}
```

- You can add params if needed, params will be passsed from the parent segment's **generateStaticParams** function
- fetch requests are automatically memoized for same data across **generateMetadata, generateStaticParams, Layouts, Pages, and Server Components**
- For local you can use React cache which i am using

## Production

![vercelBuild](/posts/NEXTJS/generate-static-params-to-improve-nextjs-13-inital-performance/generate-build-vercel.png)

As you can see from Vercel my Static file has been successfully built and create each page,
now my website will not handle files on request, it will just retrieve already created *SSG* files
