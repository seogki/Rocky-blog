This article shows how to implement next-mdx-remote to nextjs 13

First you need to install the next-mdx-remote

## Install / Configuration

```bash
npm install next-mdx-remote
yarn add next-mdx-remote
```


If you want to use tailwindcss with typography you have to install first

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography
yarn add --dev tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography
```


Since tailwindcss configuration describes well on the website, i will not going to describe details about how to config settings about it

If you have learn about tailwindcss configuration [tailwindcss configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

```js:tailwind.config.js js showLineNumbers
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      screens: {
        xs: "480px",
        "2xl": "1440px"
      }
    }
  },
  darkMode: ["class"],

  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography")]
};
```

## 1. Create mdx file

First we need to create mdx in order to display mdx file to nextjs 13

```markdown:sample.mdx showLineNumbers
---
title: title for h1 tag
date: "2023/08/22"
description: description about mdx file
tags: 'nextjs, mdx, tag'
published: true
---

contents

## sub title

information

```

Inside mdx file you can use markdown language and customize data as object, which is called **Frontmatter**, it is a YAML like key/value pairing that can be used to store data about a page

For example, i have title, date, description, tags, published, you can customize as much as you want


## 2. Get mdx files

I have created a data folder with index.ts file, and from there let's get our file


```ts:index.ts showLineNumbers
import { JSXElementConstructor, ReactElement } from "react";
import { compileMDX } from "next-mdx-remote/rsc";
import { promises as fs } from "fs";
import { cache } from "react";
import path from "path";

type Frontmatter = {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  date: string;
  published: boolean;
};

interface Post {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  date: string;
  description: string;
  published: boolean;
  tags: string;
  body: ReactElement<any, string | JSXElementConstructor<any>>;
}

/** Since it is SSR you can cover your function by react cache, and retrieve later on*/
export const getPosts = cache(async (sort = true) => {

  const list: Post[] = [];

  //so you need to change to your mdx file directory, process.cwd() shows your root directory
  const basePath = [process.cwd(), "src", "posts"];
  const filePath = path.join(...basePath);
  const files = await fs.readdir(filePath);
  const mdxFiles = files.filter((file) => path.extname(file) === ".mdx");


  for await (const mdx of mdxFiles) {
    const filePath = path.join(...basePath, mdx);

    const source = await fs.readFile(filePath, "utf8");


    const { content, frontmatter } = await compileMDX<Frontmatter>({
      options: {
        //multiple options that can customize your mdx file, and i will talk about it later
        mdxOptions: {},
        //to parse Frontmatter you have to enable it
        parseFrontmatter: true
      },
      //it is your mdx file
      source
    });

    //if published is false no not add to your list, because you don't want to display unfinished post to readers
    if (!frontmatter.published) continue;

    list.push({
      //your can use spread syntax to destructure, or just pass frontmatter as you like
      ...frontmatter,
      body: content,
      slug: mdx.replace(".mdx", "")
    } as Post);
  }

  if(!sort) return list;

  //i wanted to sort list by date from latest to oldest
  return list
    .sort((a, b) => +new Date(b.date) - +new Date(a.date));
});
```

By using **compileMDX** you can compile your mdx file to react components, since everything is done by ssr you don't have to worry about seo problems

### This is how it work

1. get your mdx file path
2. read mdx file and retrieve as source
3. convert to element by compileMDX (make sure to enable parseFrontmatter if you want to use it)
4. use spread syntax to destructure and save it as list
5. since it is cached you only have to worry about first retrievement

## 3. Create TSX file to display compiled contents


```tsx:post-item.tsx showLineNumbers
export default function PostItem() {

  const posts = await getPosts();

  if (posts.length < 1) return <>No Post Available</>;

  const post = posts[0];

  return (
    <>
      <article
        className={`post-article prose dark:prose-invert break-words`}
      >
        <Suspense
          fallback={
            <>
              <div>loading</div>
            </>
          }
        >
          <h1 className="text-center mt-4 lg:mt-8">{post.title}</h1>
          <div className="ml-auto text-right text-base py-4">
            <time>{post.date}</time>
          </div>
          {post.body}
        </Suspense>
      </article>
    </>
  );
}
```

Since mine is written in tailwindcss, it has tailwindcss code, if you don't want it you can customize styles by yourself

Suspense let's you display a fallback until its children have finished loading, you can find more about [here](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)
