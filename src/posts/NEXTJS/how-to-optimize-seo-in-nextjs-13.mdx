## What is SEO

**SEO** knowns as Search Engine Optimization is to improve your search ranking by optimizing your website.
Such as google, if you wants to show your website on the top, you need to tell google what's in your page.
Basically SEO means describe the website so that program can understand where is your title and what kinds of information do you provide in your website


## What kind of technique i can use to optimize

There are many ways to optimize your website and
these are brief informations of technique you can use to optimize **SEO**

1. Semantic HTML
2. Quality contents (such as how value is your contents are)
3. Metadata
4. robots.txt
5. sitemap.xml

We will figure out how to implement one by one

## What is Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML is a html tags that has role. 
such as header, footer, main. 
You can clearly tells that header will be on the top, main will be on the middle, and lastly footer will on the bottom

Instead of using numerous **div** tags, it's better to write in semantic html to clarify your html sturcture

### Some of Semantic HTML Introduced In HTML5

- article
- aside
- details
- figcaption
- figure
- footer
- header
- main
- mark
- nav
- section
- summary
- time 


Let's find out why we need to write semantic tags even though not using SEO

```html:semantic.html showLineNumbers
<!-- without semantic html -->
<body>
    <div></div> <!-- header -->
    <div></div> <!-- main -->
    <div></div> <!-- footer -->
</body>

<!-- with semantic html -->
<div>
 <header></header>
 <main></main>
 <footer></footer>   
</div>
```

If you look at these two html structure, it's obvious that second structure is more readable to reader. 
We don't have to comment on every tags or add random classname to show what they are doing, which makes our coding a lot more **confusing** and **difficult** to understand

### Different Semantic HTML examples

I will show you couple of examples

- **article** usually used when you wants to show information about particular thing such as post
- **section** usually used when you wants to show multiple information about contents, when you want multiple sections to describe, each section may not relate to themselves but related to main content
- **time** used to show date
- **aside** usually used to display side contents which are relate to main content (I'm using it as Table of contents information)
- **nav** used to navigate between pages, and can be used with **ul** and **li**


As a result Semantic HTML is very useful whether you use SEO or not


## Quality contents

SEO not only look at Semantic HTML but also look at **vocabulary** of it's contents. 
Better grammer with better language sturucture will be required to make SEO optimized better


## Metadata

Metadata means data inside a data. In nextjs metadata refer as data description of html page

There are couple of metadata your can define

- title
- description
- opengraph

Nextjs provide information about how to implement metadata on each page

There are **Metadata** and **generateMetadata**, Metadata is for static text which you don't need to change it's contents,
and generateMetadata usually used in dynamic route where your title, description, and more change based on route


### Add title and description
```tsx:page.tsx showLineNumbers
import { Metadata } from 'next'
 
// either Static metadata
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: `Rocky Blog - Home`,
    description: `This is my Rocky Blog Home Page with recent posts and tags`,
}
 
// or Dynamic metadata
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  return {
    title: `Rocky Blog - Home`,
    description: `This is my Rocky Blog Home Page with recent posts and tags`,
  }
}
```

Here you can use either **metadata** or **generateMetadata** to give information about what this page do


### Add dynamic metadata with params

Since dynamic metadata does not know which title and description will be given, so you need to use **generateMetadata**


```tsx:page.tsx showLineNumbers
type Props = {
  params: {
    category: string;
    slug: string;
  };
// searchParams can be retrieved too
};

export const generateMetadata = async ({
  params
}: Props): Promise<Metadata> => {
  const { category, slug } = params;
  let post: post = await getPost(slug, category);

  ...

  return {
    title: `[${category}] ${post.title}`,
    description: post.description,
    ...
  };
};
```

This is how i handle my dynamic route metadata by using **generateMetadata** function.
In nextjs 13 fetch or react.cache can be used in anywhere in server side page, 
and as you can see i was able to get params data. 
From the params i retrieved post object and used it to show title and description.


### Add ImageResponse for Open Graph images, Twitter cards, and more

ImageResponse allows to generate JSX syntax based image and used it as social media images

First you need to create opengraph-image.tsx file same folder where you want to display metadata

```tsx:opengraph-image.tsx showLineNumbers
import { ImageResponse } from "next/server";

export const runtime = "edge";

type Props = {
  params: {
    category: string;
    slug: string;
  };
};

export async function Image({ params }: Props) {
  const { category, slug } = params;

  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div
        style={{
          fontSize: 64,
          background: "#9E9E9E",
          width: "100%",
          height: "100%",
          display: "flex",
          textAlign: "center",
          alignItems: "center",
          justifyContent: "center"
        }}
      >
        [{category}] - {slug.replaceAll("-", " ")}
      </div>
    ),
    {
      width: 1200,
      height: 600
    }
  );
}
```

> Since you only need to use imageResponse in **edge** runtime, you cannot use default node modules such as **node:fs**, **node:stream** and more

Create Image function and you can get params infomration of dynamic routes.
From params i created simple open graph image with category and slug (this will be my title name).
This **opengraph-image.tsx** file will be generated at build time or dynamically at request time, which automatically added in **head**.

ImageResponse support multiple css and you can find more about [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#dynamic-image-generation)


## robots.txt

**robots.txt** help SEO to understand which contents should be crawl, normally used with sitemap.xml. 
You can either put static file in **public** folder or generate one by nextjs function

Nextjs give robots function that can create robots.txt file, make sure to put this file in root of your app folder.
More information can be found [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/robots)

```tsx:robots.ts showLineNumbers
import { MetadataRoute } from 'next'
 
export default function robots(): MetadataRoute.Robots {
  return {
    rules: {
      userAgent: '*',
      allow: '/',
      disallow: '/private/',
    },
    sitemap: 'https://acme.com/sitemap.xml',
  }
}
```

### Problems

Somehow i wasn't able to make google SEO to find robots.txt so i manually placed in public folder


## sitemap.xml

**sitemap.xml** help SEO to understand which contents should be crawl, normally used with robots.txt.
You can either create static file in **public** folder or create one with nextjs is given

This is my sitemap.ts i am using right now

```ts:sitemap.ts showLineNumbers
import { MetadataRoute } from "next";
import { getAllPostsOrderByDate, getCategories } from "@/data";
import { stringToDate } from "@/utils/date";

export default async function sitemap(): Promise<MetadataRoute.Sitemap> {
  const baseUrl = "https://www.rockyblog.dev";

  const sitemapList = [
    {
      url: baseUrl,
      lastModified: new Date()
    },
    {
      url: `${baseUrl}/posts`,
      lastModified: new Date()
    }
  ];

  const categories = await getCategories();

  for (const category of categories) {
    sitemapList.push({
      url: `${baseUrl}/posts/${category.name}`,
      lastModified: new Date()
    });
  }

  const posts = await getAllPostsOrderByDate();

  for (const post of posts) {
    if (!post || post === null) continue;

    sitemapList.push({
      url: `${baseUrl}/posts/${post.category}/${post.slug}`,
      lastModified: stringToDate(post.date, "DD/MM/YYYY")
    });
  }

  return sitemapList;
}
```

Since sitemap.ts runs during build, it acts as server side. 
You can use fetch or other functions and makes your own sitemap.xml

### Problems

Somehow i wasn't able to make google SEO to find sitemap.xml so i manually copy paste sitemap result from the sitemap.ts that i have created.
I Hope nextjs teams have better information about how to handle it.
