This article describes how to testing redux + @testing-library/react with jest in nextjs 13 in order to test

## Redux warning

I have encountered **could not find react-redux context value** warning when i tried to test my code. Client side page had redux covered, 
and i have to implement redux test in order to make test work

```text
(alias) function HeaderTitle(): JSX.Element
import HeaderTitle
header title test > header title exists

Error: could not find react-redux context value; please ensure the component is wrapped in a <Provider>Jest
```

### Redux general advice

- Prefer writing integration tests with everything work together, and use real redux logic
- *If* needed, basic test as pure function such as complex reducers or selectors, still most of detail can be covered by integration tests
- **Do not try to mock selector functions or react-redux hooks!** They say mocking imports from libraries is fragile, and doesn't give you confidence that your actual app code is working
- Recommend using **React Testing Library (RTL)** to test react components




## Setup redux



Seprate rootReducer and store so that we can extract **RootState** type

```ts:store.ts {12, 15} showLineNumbers
import {
  PreloadedState,
  combineReducers,
  configureStore
} from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import headerReducer from "./features/headerSlice";

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  header: headerReducer
});

export const setupStore = (preloadedState?: PreloadedState<RootState>) => {
  return configureStore({
    reducer: rootReducer,
    preloadedState,
    devTools: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"
  });
};

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof rootReducer>;
export type AppStore = ReturnType<typeof setupStore>;
export type AppDispatch = AppStore["dispatch"];
```


Create test-utils.tsx, This will be your custom render function, you can find more setup [here](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/setup/),
since we are testing redux i will only talk about redux right now

```tsx:test-utils.tsx {22,23,27} showLineNumbers
import React, { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import type { RenderOptions } from "@testing-library/react";
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import type { PreloadedState } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

import { AppStore, RootState, setupStore } from "@/redux/store";

// This type interface extends the default options for render from RTL, as well
// as allows the user to specify other things such as initialState, store.
interface ExtendedRenderOptions extends Omit<RenderOptions, "queries"> {
  preloadedState?: PreloadedState<RootState>;
  store?: AppStore;
}

export function renderWithProviders(
  ui: React.ReactElement,
  {
    preloadedState = {},
    // Automatically create a store instance if no store was passed in
    store = setupStore(preloadedState),
    ...renderOptions
  }: ExtendedRenderOptions = {}
) {
  function Wrapper({ children }: PropsWithChildren<{}>): JSX.Element {
    return <Provider store={store}>{children}</Provider>;
  }

  // Return an object with the store and all of RTL's query functions
  return { store, ...render(ui, { wrapper: Wrapper, ...renderOptions }) };
}
```

### Benefit of separate store creation

- Create a new Redux store every time, and **PreloadedState** value that can be used for an initial value
- Still can pass already-created Redux store instance
- Pass additional options to RTL's original render function 
- Automatically wrap the component being tested with a `<Provider store={store}></Provider>`
- Return store instance in case the test needs to dispatch more actions or check state


Since original store does not need **preloadedState**, i just created setupStore as a function with blank;

```tsx:redux-provider.tsx showLineNumbers
"use client";

import { setupStore } from "./store";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

export function ReduxProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <Provider store={setupStore()}>{children}</Provider>;
}
```


## Test

Once you done writing all the boilerplate code, check your jest code with **RenderWithProvder()**

```diff-tsx:header-title.test.tsx showLineNumbers
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import HeaderTitle from "./header-title";
import { renderWithProviders } from "@/redux/test-utils";

describe("header title test", () => {
  test("header title exists", async () => {
-    // render(<HeaderTitle />); without redux provider
+    renderWithProviders(<HeaderTitle />); //with redux provider

    const link: HTMLAnchorElement = screen.getByRole("link");

    expect(link.textContent).toEqual("Rocky Blog");
  });
});
```

If you want to use original render than use **render(components)** with provider use **renderWithProviders(component)**

## Additional tip

Sometime you need to preload data before test acutally happens, and that's when **preloadedState** is needed

Let's say my headerReducer has *isDrawerOpen* state and i want it to make it true from the start

```tsx:header-title.test.tsx showLineNumbers
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import HeaderTitle from "./header-title";
import { renderWithProviders } from "@/redux/test-utils";

describe("header title test", () => {
  test("header title exists", async () => {

    const initialHeader = []

    renderWithProviders(<HeaderTitle />); //with redux provider

    const link: HTMLAnchorElement = screen.getByRole("link");

    expect(link.textContent).toEqual("Rocky Blog");
  });
});
```
