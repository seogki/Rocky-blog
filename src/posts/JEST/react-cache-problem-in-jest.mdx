This article describes how i managed to handle react.cache type error in nextjs 13,
 i will show you the alternative ways of handling by adding custom function


## About React.cache

React cache is simply make return value cache so that when server side rendering happens, you only have to deal with function one time only

```ts:index.ts showLineNumbers
export const getCategories = cache(async () => {
  const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), "src", "posts");
  const categories = await fs.readdir(filePath);
  return categories;
});
```

I normally cache my result, because getting cateogries from same path is one time only.
I decided to use react cache which describes in [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#caching-data),
and everything worked fine, until i tried to test my code


### TypeError

```text
TypeError: (0 , _react.cache) is not a function
```

I was getting TypeError problems when my *process.env.NODE_ENV* was test, and decided to fix it.
I kept searching for react cache and how people handled about this problem, 
but did not have much informations about how to handle and how to test using jest



### What i have tried

I was able to find similar problems from nextjs [issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/49304), and he simply used moduleNameMapper and add resolved react module with react-canary version

i did not wanted to use react@canary, because it might be unstable. Nextjs 13 itself is not stable enough so i did not want additional unstable library to my package. 
In the end i just create a function which **bypass cache when NODE_ENV is test**

## Bypass function

This is how i configured to bypass react.cache in test

```ts:index.ts showLineNumbers
const isNotTest = process.env.NODE_ENV !== "test";

//this is my bypass function only works in NODE_ENV === test
function testCache<T extends Function>(func: T) {
  return func;
}
//cache is actual react.cache
const cachedFunc = isNotTest ? cache : testCache;
```

From which ever files use react.cache simply check *NODE_ENV* and define your function just to bypass.
Simple test will not need react.cache so i thought it will be ok to handle like this

## How to implement

```ts:index.ts showLineNumbers
export const getCategories = cachedFunc(async () => {
  const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), "src", "posts");
  const categories = await fs.readdir(filePath);
  return categories;
});
```

Just convert React.cache function to our cachedFunc and that it.

I will have to wait until next react.js packages or next.js, until then i am going to stick to this bypass function
