## What is Framer Motion

Framer Motion is very powerful library that handles various animations and gestures in react. 
By wrapping **Motion** Component you are able to implement animations easily.

You can control x, y, z transform, scroll event, layout, gestures and more..


## Horizontal scrollbar animation

Many Blogs has horizontal scrollbar on the top which acts as a vertical scrollbar. 
I really liked this idea because vertical scrollbar wasn't that visible to me, 
i had to look for vertical scrollbar to see how much contents are left

I have searched for such kinds of scrollbar in google, and found out that framer motion can do such thing every easily

## How to Implement

### Install

First you need to install **framer-motion** library

```bash showLineNumbers
npm install framer-motion
yarn add framer-motion
pnpm install framer-motion
```

### Scroll animations in Framer Motion

There are two types of animations in framer-motion

1. Track progress of scroll
2. Act when contents enter scroll or leave scroll viewport

We are going to handle first one 

### Add useScroll, useSpring function to handle horizontal scrollbar

By default **useScroll()** tracks page scroll

```tsx:post-scroll.tsx showLineNumbers
"use client";

import { motion, useScroll, useSpring } from "framer-motion";

export default function PostScroll() {
  const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll();
  const scaleX = useSpring(scrollYProgress, {
    stiffness: 100,
    damping: 30,
    restDelta: 0.001
  });
  return (
    <motion.div
      className="fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 h-1 bg-violet-500 origin-left"
      style={{ scaleX }}
    ></motion.div>
  );
}
```

**useScroll()** returns scrollYProgress variable, by using it we can show vertical scroll to horizontal scrollbar.
Since we are going to animate scrollbar progress, we need to add one more function which is **useSpring()**.

### So What is Spring?

Spring is an animation that simulates spring physics for realistic motion works in default phyiscal values like x, y, scale and rotate.

Just like the name of spring, it is easily movable and return to original shape after, 
since it's affecting to force spring gets stretched and compressed.

Now we know some basic concept of spring and why they named it as spring,
let's find out some of options framer motion provide

#### Some of Options in Spring

- **Stiffness**: Sudden moventment of animation, higher the value more sudden movement will occur. default: 1000
- **Damping**: Strengh of opposing force. default: 10
- **restDelta**: When animation end, spring gets snapped to. default: 0.01

## Result

As you can see everytime vertical scrollbar moves my purple horizontal scrollbar change as well.

Framer Motion is not only handles about scroll but also has many more animations we can check out!
