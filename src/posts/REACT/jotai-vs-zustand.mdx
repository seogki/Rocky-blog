State managment libraries have increasing tremendous amount for last couple of years,
and more state management libraries are getting improved by itself. **Redux** is one of them and **recoil**, **jotai**, **zustand** and etc...

## What is State Management

As the project grows up we need to manage our changed state significantly, 
by managing our state fluently project become more sturctured and readable.

You may not want redundant state in multiple components, you may want to keep states globally to use it whenever you needed,
**useState**, **context api**, **useReducer** can be the alternative, hence using those api is totally fine, until you find out those api is not enough.

Redux is one of most famous state management library, a lot of people are using it with almost 60k git stars.
As the time goes more **redux** user starting question about it's structure, 
because **redux** has way too many boilerplate codes that they had to write just for simple global state management,
and decided look around to see if there are alternative, that's where **jotai**, **zustand**, **recoil** popup.

## What is Zotai

**Jotai** is atomic approach to global React state managment with 15k git stars, so what is atomic here means?


### Atomic Approach

**atom** usually means a value or component which can't be break down anymore. If you know information about **atomic design** you might understand it.
In **jotai** single state is called **atom**, and create function by using this atom which is derivated function.

In Result you can use it just like **useState** hook.

```tsx:example.tsx showLineNumbers
import { atom, useAtom } from 'jotai'

// define atom
const textAtom = atom('hello') // atom
const uppercaseAtom = atom( //derivated function
  (get) => get(textAtom).toUpperCase()
)

// implement defined atom
const Input = () => {
    const [text, setText] = useAtom(textAtom);
    const [uppercase] = useAtom(uppercaseAtom);

    return <>
        {text}
        {uppercase}
    </>
}
```

### Features

- Minial core api is 2kb
- Based on typescript
- Support nextjs, gatsby, remix, and react native
- React Fast Refresh with swc and babel plugins


### Check How Atom Work

If you see imported primitive atom from **jotai** you can see it returns 
primitiveAtom withInitialValue type.

I have extracted some important types.

```ts:atom.ts showLineNumbers
export function atom<Value>(
  initialValue: Value
): PrimitiveAtom<Value> & WithInitialValue<Value>



//primitiveAtom has value and setValue type
export type PrimitiveAtom<Value> = WritableAtom<
  Value,
  [SetStateAction<Value>],
  void
>

type WithInitialValue<Value> = {
  init: Value
}

export interface WritableAtom<Value, Args extends unknown[], Result>
  extends Atom<Value> {
  read: Read<Value, SetAtom<Args, Result>>
  write: Write<Args, Result>
  onMount?: OnMount<Args, Result>
}

```

Since Atom returns Value and SetValue type, we can use it as **useState** like function.


When single atom create, each atom gets unqiue key which is globally increasing by 1,
by determining whether function or not state being management properly inside config object.

Since atom create own key, 
we don't have to define key that give us less boilerplate code by little amount.

This is part of github code how atom is being created.

```ts:atom.ts showLineNumbers
let keyCount = 0 // global key count for all atoms

export function atom<Value, Args extends unknown[], Result>(
  read: Value | Read<Value, SetAtom<Args, Result>>,
  write?: Write<Args, Result>
) {
  const key = `atom${++keyCount}`
  const config = {
    toString: () => key,
  } as WritableAtom<Value, Args, Result> & { init?: Value }
  if (typeof read === 'function') {
    config.read = read as Read<Value, SetAtom<Args, Result>>
  } else {
    config.init = read
    config.read = (get) => get(config)
    config.write = ((get: Getter, set: Setter, arg: SetStateAction<Value>) =>
      set(
        config as unknown as PrimitiveAtom<Value>,
        typeof arg === 'function'
          ? (arg as (prev: Value) => Value)(get(config))
          : arg
      )) as unknown as Write<Args, Result>
  }
  if (write) {
    config.write = write
  }
  return config
}
```


## What is Zustand

**Zustand** is one of state management library with around 35k git stars, which use flux patterns just like **redux**. 
It is simpler than redux like jotai but define state as object.

```ts:zustand.ts showLineNumbers
import { create } from 'zustand'

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
}))
```

Store state by using create function. Each store can store primitive value, objects, functions and more,
**set** parameter which passed from create will be merge state.

```ts:zustand.ts showLineNumbers
function BearCounter() {
  const bears = useStore((state) => state.bears)
  return <h1>{bears} around here...</h1>
}

function Controls() {
  const increasePopulation = useStore((state) => state.increasePopulation)
  return <button onClick={increasePopulation}>one up</button>
}
```

After initializing store, we can use it just like redux.

## Jotai Vs Zustand

Let's find out pros and cons of these two library

### Jotai

#### Pros

1. Simple.
2. Key is being generated own (we don't have to deal with it).

#### Cons

1. having problems with async (has alternative but code can be ugly)
2. May sufficient for small state manage (when comes to complex state hard to manage)
3. Since less structured than redux and zustand, which might hard to predict state update.

### Zustand

#### Pros

1. Flux patterns like Redux. (if you know redux, it's easy to implement)
2. Good for complex state manage
3. Support middleware and DevTools

#### Cons

1. Code is not much different to redux because it's flux pattern.
2. 

Since jotai and zustand all made by same people with to solve different problem,
it will be our choice to choose whether to use jotai or zustand based on our taste.

Both of them is meant to handle state, which can be occur in local client side. 
If you want to deal with api, it will be better to use **swr**, **react-query** which has more features like caching.

Lastly this is trending npm donwload package of state management library.
